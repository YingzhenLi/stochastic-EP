Installing the Beamer class
===========================

* TeX stuff:

  + For the impatient:

    Put all files somewhere where TeX can find them. Also install the following
    packages somewhere where TeX can find them:

    - pgf, version >= 1.00
    - xcolor, version >= 2.00

   + Long version:

     In the users guide, which you can find in the file doc/beameruserguide.pdf,
     you will find a detailed explanation on how to install the beamer class.

* Emacs Stuff:

  There is a file emacs/beamer.el that adds some beamer stuff to emacs' AucTeX
  mode. Read the instructions in that file on how to install it.
