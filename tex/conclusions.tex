\section{Conclusions and future work}
We have presented stochastic expectation propagation as a remedy of EP's large memory consumption problem. We also discussed the behaviour of SEP in average, and provided its connections to the widely used stochastic variational inference algorithm by framing them in the same optimisation framework.

Experiments on synthetic Bayesian logistic regression showed that SEP performs almost as well as EP. And we further presented examples on big data classification problems by correcting the recently developed ADF-style probabilistic back-propagation. To our knowledge we are the first to propose scalable EP as a deterministic Bayesian computing framework with stochastic optimisation with successful real-world tests. However our theoretical results of this novel algorithm are quite coarse, also the double-loop framework in global/local optimisation flavour are of little understanding in general. Future work should be done on further analysis of SEP, and experiments on various machine learning problems to provide empirical comparisons of EP with other scalable Bayesian approaches on large-scale machine learning tasks.
